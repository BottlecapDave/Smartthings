# Smartthings
Contains various application for use with smartthings

## EnergyNotifier

This application monitors the energy consumption of a power meter. 
If it exceeds a configurable threshold for a configurable amount of time, then a push notification is sent to the users device.

This was built so that I got reminded when I accidently left my computer on.

## Energy Saver

This application monitors the energy consumption of a power meter.
If the energy falls below a configurable threshold for a configurable amount of time, then the plug will switch off.
You can optionally configure the timeframe that the monitoring will occur.

This was built so that devices would not be left in standby.
